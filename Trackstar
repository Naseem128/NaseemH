hey welcome Wassup bro


not much the top left 2 folders is the explorer button shows the files your currently in

there are 3 extensions you download but beffore that click this button with a small 

magnifying glass and 2 rectangles together in the top right
okay clicked it

what happened?
I see preview nice the language we are using now is 

### MarkDown ###

--- 

its for making notes for projects, typing blogs, and other cool stuff

Okay got it so the preview is just showing everything without the codes?

the preview shows you how it looks in the browser some markdown code is like 

3 - together 

or # space  then words and # for a heading

# heading 1 #
## heading 2 ##

Oh I understand now thats cool i'm excited to learn all this 

awsome you will also need to learn the terminal below

ok where it says (base) ? user@
yeah everything in the computer is either a file or a folder


---

in the terminal we are in my Portfolio_2022 Folder in __User__ folder


the folder tree goes like this 

Root -> user -> desktop -> (music|document|other folders on desktop)



Okay I think I understand a little bit lets do a little python we will change to my new folder

nvm you have to download some extensions you see the 3 cubes in a L shape

Yeah I see 

cool click it and search these extensions 

* python (microsoft)

* github repositories

* live share (microsoft)

okay downloading now okay cool lets practice some mark down

make a heading just like mine just diffrent words

### Cool Heading ### 

### Track ###



💪🏽

now thats heading 1 the biggest font lets change ours to heading 2 or 3

okay did it nice 

you need the same amount of #'s on each side to have that heading ( Got it)

to make bullited list do this

* Spikes
* arm sleeves

* Headband

cool now with python to make a comment you use

# 
 but you use it in python files 

#
Naseem 

got it 

you see the new photo i added

where at?

click the explorer button

I dont see the explorer button

thats cool the explorer button is the 2 files icon on top of each other

I see

on the left at the top

it shows you the files open in VSCode and files in the current project

Okay i see im on the picture

nice thats kinda what i mean by the tree 

oh okay I understand that now what you were saying

yeah so the terminal that says user below

we are in the user folder and instead of keith folder its Portfolio_2022

okay okay so the Users 

yeah if you open the terminal when we done you will start in the user folder

if you open the terminal while in a project you will start in that project Folder

Okay I got it

cool there are 2 most common commands for the terminal 

* cd 
* mkdir

cd is _Change Directory_

mkdir is make directory 

O


every folder is a directory

oh so that is how you woudl change the folder? 

yeah lets create a folder each

ls command is list 
* showing you whats inside of a current folder

just created a new folder your turn 

mkdir 

so just anyname?

yeah any name with a folder name you cant put spaces

you got it mkdir derrick nice you have your explorer tab open?

yessir

you see our new folders 

yeah 

cool now check what files we have in Portfolio_2022

using the ls command

nice  now we have 2 folders to choose from within Portfolio change to either one of them

# 🕺🏽 # 

if you press the up arrow you can repeat commands you entered 

check whats in the folder you moved too

nice if you ever need to just copy the same one or make a slight change like this

now move backwards up the folder tree


using cd .

you missed inner and lowercase folder
nice

we are in the User folder
okay

So how would we save everything

so this is a new repository i created in github 

and opened in vscode 

to save this we would make a *_Commit_* 

we can just save it with the save open under File and get back to it 

or we can update it on Github with a commit


okay got it

create a repository in github after this and that bottom left button > < or the one next to it is for Github files

its a lot we covered so we will leave it at this

okay ill do it right now 

I dont see it 

try the cat icon to the left 

i open github?

yeah open github and create a new repository

okay got it and name it anything? 

yeah what ever comes to mind

okay I created one

nice named NassemH 
Yes


so  if you click the repository you should see a green button that says code

I dont see it on github right 
do you see quick setup

yes

do create new file

yes so create a new file?


yeah with anyname with the .md extension at the end of the name

then just some randome text and commit changes at the very bottom

okay 

nice would you like to save this text ?

Done!

nice name choice too

so if you click the repository you can see the green code button

to upload it to your VSCODE you need to choose github cli also known as Github Command Line interace

gh repo clone Naseem128/NaseemH this is the code you should see

Okay I see it 

so now I download?

no this is when you copy that code and enter it into the terminal co

nttrol C copy 
control V pas

where it says Read-only file

yeah
that means we can not make any edits to the file 

we need to have it read-write

okay

is it good now?

no but it could be if you try itt in your own VScode App

so if you go to the repository and click the trackstar file 

you should see raw | blame a pencil and down arrow

okay i see it 

click the down arrow and edit in github dev

okay openednn

okay add some text 

Okay I did  next tap the 3 circles connecting each up 

Enter a name like first commit and taap the check mark

okay did it

nice did you see the changes on your github?

yeah

# 🗣 Noice # 

git hub is known as version control 

like

oh okay I think I understand that  naseemH v1 and naseemh v2 etc. you can move around changes for diffrent versions
 

 it wont  click immedialtly atleast it didnt for me but with a few attempts to move between
 versions it will. 

 okay it changed

 if you go to the front page of that repository (repositories are just projects)

 it shows you made 4 commits 

 yeah I see


 okay got it so basically older versions and newer versions

 Im going to head to bed in a bit, I appreciate you taking the time to help me learn all this. And will all this save right here?



 okay I will right now

 how would i copy it?
